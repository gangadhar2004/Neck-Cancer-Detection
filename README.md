# Neck Cancer Detection

## Project Overview

This project is designed to detect and classify images of neck cancer. It uses machine learning models to predict whether an image depicts a normal case or oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

## Features

- Image Classification: Classifies uploaded images into 'normal' or 'OSCC'.
- Deep Learning Models: Utilizes InceptionV3, VGG16, and ResNet50 models with an ensemble approach for accurate predictions.
- Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving predictions.
